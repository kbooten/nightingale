# *Nightingale*

*Nightingale* is a Chrome browser extension that injects literary pop-up ads (lines from Keats's five major odes of 1819) into the web.   

The resonances between lines of Keats's verse and fragments of web-pages are painstakingly encoded as a series of 136 regular expressions, each itself a "close-reading" that tries to consider what echoes there may be between the line and web pages I might visit.  For instance, web-text matching the regular expression:

>`/\b([A-Z]\w+d (songs|melodies) are)\b|\bthose \w+ are \w+er\b|\b(\w+s are sweet)\b/`

will trigger a pop-up containing the lines:

>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard  
>Are sweeter
